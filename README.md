#### InputHotkeyBlock
**v1.0 - [Download](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/COM3D2_Plugins/releases/download/v1/COM3D2.InputHotkeyBlock.v1.0.zip)**<br/>

Prevents hotkeys from plugins from triggering while typing in input fields.

Because input fields don't ever seem to lose focus on their own, I added the ability to force them to lose focus by right clicking anywhere.
