#### COM3D2 API
**v1.0 - [Download](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/COM3D2_Plugins/releases/download/v3/COM3D2.API.v1.0.zip)**

API plugin that can be used to do stuff. Currently, it only has an API for adding buttons to the SystemShortcut (gear icon) menu. Feel free to use it to add your own buttons.

#### ConfigurationManagerWrapper
**v1.0 - [Download](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/COM3D2_Plugins/releases/download/v3/COM3D2.ConfigurationManagerWrapper.v1.0.zip)**

Adds a button to the menu which opens the [BepInEx.ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) window. Requires the COM3D2 API.

#### InputHotkeyBlock
**v1.2 - [Download](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/COM3D2_Plugins/releases/download/v5/COM3D2.InputHotkeyBlock.v1.2.zip)**

Prevents hotkeys from plugins from triggering while typing in input fields.

Because input fields don't ever seem to lose focus on their own, input fields are forced to lose focus when clicking anywhere outside of them. When no input field is focused, hotkeys will function as normal.
