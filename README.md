#### InputHotkeyBlock
**v1.1 - [Download](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/COM3D2_Plugins/releases/download/v2/COM3D2.InputHotkeyBlock.v1.1.zip)**<br/>

Prevents hotkeys from plugins from triggering while typing in input fields.

Because input fields don't ever seem to lose focus on their own, input fields are forced to lose focus when clicking anywhere outside of them. When no input field is focused hotkeys will function as normal.
